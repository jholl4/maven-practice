	 * In title case, major words are capitalized, and minor words (3 letters or

	 * “The” or “A”
	 * - the first word of a subtitle
	 * - the first word after a colon, em dash, or end punctuation in a heading
	 * - major words, including the second part of hyphenated major words
	 * (e.g., “Self-Report,” not “Self-report”)
	 * - words of four letters or more (e.g., “With,” “Between,” “From”)
	 *

	 * (except the first word in a title or subtitle or the first word after a

	 * - short conjunctions (e.g., “and,” “as,” “but,” “for,” “if,” “nor,” “or,”
	 * “so,” “yet”)
	 * - articles (“a,” “an,” “the”)
